10/25/2022,Is your themepark going to have more of a blog theme or a calculator theme for deciding on what the best PC build would be?,"I would recommend editing the presentation's CSS to make it more personal. I would also recommend moving custom CSS and JavaScript to their own files to make everything more organized. I noticed the pictures are off center and feel oddly placed, so adding some CSS to that would help.","It's going to be more of a blog theme type of website. Creating a function for the most optimized build might be a little overwhelming for me to do when I have other classes. Also, I would love to add more css detailing and add a framework but it's been hard to get a good UI/UX inspiration.",11/5/2022
